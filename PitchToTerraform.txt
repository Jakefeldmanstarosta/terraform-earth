To whom it may concern,

Pitch for an internship that doesn't exist: 1. I do good work. 2. I'm relentless about it. 

I liked Casey's interview on the Dwarkesh podcast. It was refreshing to hear someone who values merit and drive over image. I assume that mindset runs through your company, judging by your policy on math proficiency. You do good work, and I want in.

Last summer, I worked at an engineering consulting firm doing electronics IP, where the work, frankly, explored ethically grey areas. I pitched an alternative project aligned with my values and built a vector database that cut lookup time by 60%, saving an hour per engineer per day. I don’t just do good work; I find it.

I’ve already received an offer from Palantir for $120K over 12 months. That's not leverage, but proof I’m willing to trade money for meaning.

Right now:
Lead three applied AI projects (20 people): medical-imaging triage, embedded NN on a
mobile robot, RAG consulting collab.
Chair the largest undergraduate AI conference in Canada.
Take 7 courses (the most of any student at my university).
Maintain a 4.0 GPA.

I'm happy to send my resume or transcripts. I left them out on purpose. If this email comes off forward, it’s because I give a damn. I’m nice in person.

Looking forward to your response.

All the best,
